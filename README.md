I'm Elvis from Tennessee, a US ARMY Veteran and Software Engineer. I once use to hunt bad guys, but today I am just a dad and husband writing code enjoying my coffee while figuring out problems. I graduated from Austin Peay State University with a 4 year degree in Computer Science  / Information Systems and a Minor in Mobile Development. I have an array of skills and experience when it comes to programming and development. I love art and engineering and that comes with solving complex problems but ultimatly helping others by creating technology people love. Go check my twitter out and reach out to me.
