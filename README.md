I'm Elvis from Tennessee, a US ARMY Veteran who is now a software engineer. I graduated from Austin Peay State University with a degree in Computer Science  / Information Systems and a Minor in Mobile Development. I have an array of skills when it comes to programming and development and these skills came from hard work and the passion I have in not only solving complex problems but helping others and creating technology people love.
