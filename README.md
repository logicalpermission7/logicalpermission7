<h1 align="center">👨🏾‍💻 Hi there 👋</h1>

I'm Elvis from Tennessee, a US ARMY Veteran who is now a software engineer. I graduated from Autin Peay State University with a degree in Computer Science and Information Systems with a Minor in Mobile Development. I love solving problems, creating content and innovation. I've built applications for Apple and Android, all sorts of websites, Weather Apps, Games, Sport Applications and API's published on RapidAPI. I will continue to build and innovate because I love technology and how it has helped us humans communicate and share.
