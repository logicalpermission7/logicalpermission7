<h2>Hi 👨🏾‍💻 there 👋, my name is Elvis</h2>


#### FULL STACK ENGINEER / DESIGN AND DEVLOPMENT
I'm Elvis from Tennessee, a US ARMY Veteran and Software Engineer. Today you can find me writing code and enjoying my coffee while figuring out problems and ideas. I graduated from Austin Peay State University with a degree in Computer Science  / Information Systems and a Minor in Mobile Development. I have some experience when it comes to programming and development but I am always learning new things. I love art and engineering and that comes with solving complex problems but ultimatly helping others by creating technology people love. Go check my twitter out and reach out to me.
